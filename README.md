# Installation on Unix or Linux based systems

1. __Requirements.__ Make sure the following requirements are satisfied:
    - install ``pdftotext``. This comes with the texlive distribution on linux,
    On ubuntu, ``sudo apt-get install poppler-utils`` . 
    - install ``fzf``: https://github.com/junegunn/fzf
    - install ``GNU grep``,  ``ag`` (silver searcher).

2. __Install binary__. Do either one of the two steps below:
    - __Compile from source with ``go`` and ``go get``.__
    With a working ``golang`` installation, do 
    ```go get github.com/bellecp/fast-p```
    It will fetch the code and its dependencies,
    compile and create an executable ``fast-p`` in the ``/bin`` folder of your go
    installation, typically ``~/go/bin``. Make sure the command ``fast-p`` can be
    found (for instance, add ``~/go/bin`` to your ``$PATH``.)
    - Or: __Use the precompiled binary for your architecture.__ Download the binary that corresponds to your
    architecture at https://github.com/bellecp/fast-p/releases and make sure that
    the command ``fast-p`` can be found. For instance,
    put the binary file ``fast-p`` in ``~/custom/bin`` and add ``export
    PATH=~/custom/bin:$PATH`` to your ``.bashrc``.

3. __Tweak your .bashrc__. Add the following code to your ``.bashrc``
```
p () {
    local open
    if [ "$(uname)" = "Darwin" ]; then
        open=open       # on OSX, "open" opens a pdf in preview
    else
        open=xdg-open   # this will open pdf file withthe default PDF viewer on KDE, xfce, LXDE and perhaps on other desktops.
    fi
    
    interactive_find() {
    # bash func to return the found pdf file name/path
        ag -U -g ".pdf$" \
        | fast-p \
        | fzf --read0 --reverse -e -d $'\t'  \
            --preview-window down:80% --preview '
                v=$(echo {q} | tr " " "|"); 
                echo -e {1}"\n"{2} | grep -E "^|$v" -i --color=always;
            ' \
        | gcut -z -f 1 -d $'\t' | tr -d '\n' | xargs -I F echo "F"
    }
    
    last_found_pdf=$(interactive_find) # store the last found pdf in the variable
    echo $last_found_pdf
    open "$last_found_pdf" # Double quote to deal with filepath with spaces"
}

```
- You may replace ``ag -U -g ".pdf$"`` with another command that returns a list of pdf files.
- You may replace ``open=...`` by your favorite PDF viewer, for instance ``open=evince`` or ``open=okular``.

# Installation on OSX with homebrew

1. Install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and  __run__
```
brew install bellecp/fast-p/fast-pdf-finder
```
_The above brew formula is experimental. 
Please report any issues/suggestions/feedback at <https://github.com/bellecp/fast-p/issues/11>_


2. __Tweak your .bashrc__. Add the following code to your ``.bashrc``
```
p () {
    local open
    open=open   # on OSX, "open" opens a pdf in preview
    ag -U -g ".pdf$" \
    | fast-p \
    | fzf --read0 --reverse -e -d $'\t'  \
        --preview-window down:80% --preview '
            v=$(echo {q} | gtr " " "|"); 
            echo -e {1}"\n"{2} | ggrep -E "^|$v" -i --color=always;
        ' \
    | gcut -z -f 1 -d $'\t' | gtr -d '\n' | gxargs -r --null $open > /dev/null 2> /dev/null
}

```
- You may replace ``ag -U -g ".pdf$"`` with another command that returns a list of pdf files.
- You may replace ``open=...`` by your favorite PDF viewer, for instance ``open=evince`` or ``open=okular``.

__Remark:__ On OSX, we use the command line tools ``gcut``, ``gxargs``, ``ggrep``, ``gtr`` which are the GNU versions
of the tools ``cut``, ``xargs``, ``grep``, ``tr``. This way, we avoid the specifics of the versions of these tools pre-installed on OSX,
and the same ``.bashrc`` code can be used for both OSX and GNU Linux systems.

# Usage

Use the command ``p`` to browse among the PDF files in the current directory and its subdirectories.

The first run of the command will take some time to cache the text extracted from each pdf. Further runs of the command will be much faster since the text extraction will only apply to new pdfs.

# How to clear the cache?

To clear the cache (which contains text extracted from PDF), you may safely remove the file 
``~/.cache/fast-p-pdftotext-output/fast-p_cached_pdftotext_output.db``, or  
``~/.cache/fast-p_cached_pdftotext_output.db`` in older version.

# Is the historical bash code still available?

Yes, see https://github.com/bellecp/fast-p/blob/master/p but using the go binary as explained above is recommended for speed and interoperability.
